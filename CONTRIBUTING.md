# Contributing to apt2sbom

This code comes precisely with one guarantee: it has bugs.  It's also
incomplete in certain ways.  Your help is appreciated.  All
contributions will be considered on the basis that they are freely
given.  I reserve the right to not include a contribution, but you
are more than welcome to fork the project and go on from there.

There is no specific coding style.  If you think you your code might
be opaque, do comment; but don't go overboard.

Feel free to also open issues; or if you like, to contribute PRs to
issues that are posted.

Want to be a co-contributor?  The more the merrier.  Just let me know.
